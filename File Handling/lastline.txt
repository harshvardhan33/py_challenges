In other words, each line is a set of fields, separated by colon characters. 
The first field is the username, and the third field is the ID of the user. 
Thus, on my system, the nobody user has ID -2, the root user has ID 0. 
and the daemon user has ID 1.  
You can ignore all but the first and third fields in the file.

  Problem Statement:
    Imagine an accounting routine used in a book shop.
    It works on a list with sublists, which look like this:
        
    Order Number  Book Title  Author Quantity  Price per Item
    34587 Learning Python, Mark Lutz  4 40.95
    98762 Programming Python, Mark Lutz 5 56.80
    77226 Head First Python, Paul Barry 3 32.95
    88112 Einführung in Python3, Bernd Klein  3 24.99    
    
    Write a Python program, 
    A) which returns Order Summary as a list with 2-tuples. 
       Each tuple consists of the order number and the product of the price per items 
       and the quantity. 
    
       The product should be increased by 10 INR if the value of the order is smaller 
    than 100.00 INR.

  Hint: 
    Write a Python program using lambda and map.

  Problem Statement:
    The same bookshop, but this time we work on a different list.
    
    The sublists of our lists look like this:
    [ordernumber, (article number, quantity, price per unit), 
    ... (article number, quantity, price per unit) ]
       
    [ [1, ("5464", 4, 9.99), ("8274",18,12.99), ("9744", 9, 44.95)], 
      [2, ("5464", 9, 9.99), ("9744", 9, 44.95)],
      [3, ("5464", 9, 9.99), ("88112", 11, 24.99)],
      [4, ("8732", 7, 11.99), ("7733",11,18.99), ("88112", 5, 39.95)] ]
    
   Write a program which returns a list of list with 
    [order number, total amount of order].
    
  Hint: 
    use lambda, map and reduce concept to solve the problem

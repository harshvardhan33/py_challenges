"""

Writing programs can be frustrating 
  - if you get stuck don't give up!

Use the internet for help (but not the answer!)

Use the help features of the programming development environment.

Use features like break points and variable watches to try to

work out what is happening if the program doesn’t seem to
work.

Work with other students on the course—’two heads are better
than one’
